# shmash
i give up on porting this to c++
blah blah just shm_init and then call shm_alloc and shm_free like u would call malloc and free
dont forget to call shm_close once u r done bc u will run out of shm and stuff ok cool bye

if i ever get around to it, there will be a table at offset 0 where every object allocated will be associated with a name so u can share objects but that may never happen as i am super lazy
